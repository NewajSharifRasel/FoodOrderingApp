## ðŸ›’ FoodOrderingApp â€“ A Simple Food Ordering App
ReactFood is a clean and interactive single-page food ordering web application built with React. It demonstrates how to fetch data from a backend, manage global state using React Context, and implement modal-based cart and checkout flows.

This project simulates a basic food ordering experience including:

Displaying a list of meals fetched from a REST API.

Adding meals to a shopping cart.

Viewing and managing items in the cart (increase/decrease quantity).

Navigating between cart and checkout modals.

Basic responsive and stylish UI with custom buttons and modal animations.
